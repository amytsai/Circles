Circles
=======

This is a quick project I developed in one afteroon while experimenting with HTML5 and CSS3. CSS 3 is used to animate the circle flipping animation. Javascript is used to trigger the animations and randomize the color and animation times.

A live demo can be seen [here](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~amytsai/circles)
